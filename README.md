# DIGITAL-WALLET-TUTOR_bug_squashers-

As we are moving towards a cashless society, there is an increase in users of fintech applications and online payment systems. Yet many people above age 40 find it difficult to use digital wallet platforms and online payment systems. Here is our project to help those people. We provide simple tutorial videos to explain the basic features of a digital wallet application, which will help them to carry on their money transfers and bill payments with comfort. The videos are in Marathi, which will make it easier to understand for a native speaker.
